## About
The e-commerce web application, designed to emulate real-world e-commerce platforms, offers users the capability to browse and add items from a diverse range of categories to their shopping cart. Users can effortlessly remove items from their cart and proceed to generate a purchase summary and checkout.

For authenticated users (using Okta), the application provides an additional feature: the ability to access their purchase history. This functionality enables users to review and track their past purchases, enhancing their overall shopping experience and facilitating future transactions.

Moreover, the application utilizes Stripe payments, adding an extra layer of realism to the purchasing process by integrating a widely used and trusted payment gateway.
